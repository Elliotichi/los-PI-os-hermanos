An IOT Project for improving certain infastructure within Robert Gordons University 

This project will consist of 3 nodes, a room node that will use an nfc reader, and CO2 sensor(TBD) to collect room data, a parking node that will collect data about the cars using the car park, and a hub/gateway node that will gather this data and display it onto a web interface.
